	This submod adds a lot of miscellaneous additions to RimVore-2, most of which are configurable.

	Animals get 3 new trainables- 
		Playful predation - 2 steps, low difficulty, no trainability required, no size requirements
			Allows the animal to engage in vore on their own. They request to eat colonists, and just eat animals.
			Disabling training also disables their ability to play pred.

		Predation - 3 steps, moderate difficulty, intermediate trainability required, 0.45 size and greater
			Allows the animal to vore downed raiders. They will ignore anyone reserved by another pawn (such as a capture order, or being hunted).
			You can use designations in the vore widget to prevent them from eating raiders you're interested in.

		Endo-rescue - 4 steps, moderatly high difficulty, intermediate trainability required, 0.45 size and greater
			Allows the animal to heal-vore downed colonists and visitors. They'll also heal-vore those who's wounds have already been tended to if they're badly hurt.
	
	These trainables won't do much if the animal can't engage in the proper vore goals.
	The mod Xenobionic Patcher can allow you to install vore enablers in your animals, among other things.

	Here's each setting catagory, and what each setting does, in detail...

	Encumbrance -
		This submod replaces RV2's encumbrance system with one that takes into account relative sizes of predator and prey.

		Size-based encumbrance scaling - Toggles encumbering predators by total size of prey or by total count. Prey-of-prey are included in both counts.

		Encumbrance multiplier - Sets how heavy prey are. Setting to 0% effectivly disables all encumbrance.

		Visible "Weighed down" hediff - The "weighted down" that applies the movement reduction can be made invisible, saving space in the health tab.
						It will still affect pawns, and can always be seen by hoving over their Moving capacity in their health tab.

		Due to how the encumbrance scaling works, disabling size-based encumbrance scaling will not revert to RimVore-2's methods for encumbrance, instead using a method that aproximates it.
		This can cause problems if, for instance, a pawn of yours has 15 muffalo stored in their stomach. RV2 only counts the first 4; this submod counts them all.
		To revert, set encumbrance multiplier to 0% and remove Patches/Patch_Hediffs_Vore_CapmodRemoval.xml from this submod's Common folder(RV2_Misc/Common/Patches/Patch_Hediffs_Vore_CapmodRemoval.xml).

	Endo Stuff -
		Endo sickness strength - "Endo sickness" is a mostly-harmless hediff that makes pawns loopy, but comfortably numb.
					 It helps keep prey in a good mood, while nerfing endo storage indirectly and adding a bit of fun mental imagery.
					 Every vore-tick (250 game ticks (about 5 seconds real time)), it will advance in severity for any prey that has been endo-vored.

		Endo pacification - When endo sickness reaches 95% severity, pawns can no longer struggle. Hostile pawns are also made prisoners.

		Age regression strength - Lets pawns regress in age while safely contained within a womb. Pawns lose age every vore-tick, with the setting being "every day, lose X days of age".
					  Pawns won't revert past their biological adulthood; 18 years for humans, though nearly every species and race are adults at different ages.

		Chronic regression - Age-regressing pawns can be cured of chronic conditions, like a bad back or even carcinomas.
				     The odds are low, rising as they get younger, and they need to be young enough before it can happen at all.

		Relationship thoughts - Positive mood boosts for endophilicly holding lovers, bonded animals, or voraphilic pets. Occurs for both predator and prey.

		Endo pets - Gives a predator and prey a special opinion-boosting relationship if they spend the set amount of days together in a single vore stage. Best(or rather, only) done with storage vore.
			    Prey can only have their one pred, but preds can have multiple prey. They will be upset if something happens to their endo-buddy.

		Pets join - If a prey becomes a pet, they'll join your faction. Remember; vore is overpowered. Please show some restraint. Some, you don't have to show much.

	Lovin' - 
		Voraphile 3-ways - Gives some recreational need and a positive mood boost to prey contained within lovers while they're doing their thing.

		Gut lovin' chance - Predators and prey that are romanticaly involved can opt to do some gut lovin' while resting. 
				    The exact odds are based on age and quirks, with this setting being both a final multiplier and a hours-on-average modifier.
				    Gut lovin' shares the normal cooldown that lovin' has, and some preds or prey consider it a turn-off.

		One-nom-stands - Allows predators without a lover to gut love prey.

		Allow non-con - Allows for psycopathic or low opinion predators to gut love prey that don't want it.
			        Will absolutly destroy relationships.

	Living meals -

		Fodder chance - The odds that a colonist will decide to try to vore a prisoner marked as fodder, rather than getting normal food.
				There's a little more to the odds than just that, such as distance, goal preference, relative sizes and if no regular food is available, but at 100% colonists will almost always head to the prison for a meal.
				This will dramaticaly increase the amount of auto-vore happening, for better or worse.

		Named animals can fodder - Allows animals with a name to also eat fodder prisoners.
					   Any animal can be named through their Training tab, and bonded animals are named automaticaly.
					   Note that animals cannot be "unnamed".

		Colony predators can fodder - Allows any animal in your colony that is a natural predator to eat fodder prisoners.

		Colony animals can fodder - Allows any animal in your colony, period, to eat fodder prisoners.

		Colony animals can fodder non-prisoners - Allows colony animals to eat non-prisoners as fodder. Does nothing if the options below it are disabled.

		All auto-fodder options below have a base 50% chance to fail.
		
		Misc. fodder chance - The odds a non-prisoner will be chosen as fodder. Does nothing if the options below it are disabled.

		Pen animals are fodder - Allows for any colony animal that is blocked by fencing to be fodder. Named animals and the last 4 of any species (2 males, 2 females) are always exempt.

		Colony animals are fodder - Allows for any colony animal that is not a natural predator or is small to be fodder. Named animals and the last 4 of any species (2 males, 2 females) are always exempt.

		Colony predators are fodder - Allows for any colony animal that is a natural predator to be fodder. Named animals and the last 4 of any species (2 males, 2 females) are always exempt.

		Colony guests are fodder - Allows for guests of the colony to be fodder. Opinion influences the odds of being chosen, with low opinion giving higher chances. Will cause problems.

		Colonists are fodder - Allows for your colonists to be fodder. Opinion influences the odds of being chosen, with low opinion giving higher chances. Will cause !!fun!!.

	Capturing -
		Endo capture - Hostiles that are in pain-shock or unconsious are captured if endo-vored. Works best with healing vore.

		Capture insectoids - Hostile insects, like those spawned as infestation events, are removed from their faction if endo-captured, allowing you to tame them.

		Scaria cure - Manhunting animals infected with scaria are cured when heal-vored, allowing you to tame them.

		Endo recruitment - Slowly lowers prisoner resistance when they are willingly endo'ed. Requires the prisoner to be set to "reduce resistance" or "recruit".
				   Does not affect the unwavering.


		Your colony animals trained in predation will endo-capture if they can heal-vore, and cannot fatal-vore. This can be set up with their designations in the vore widget.
		They'll also only endo-capture/rescue insectoids and wildlife that you designate to tame.

	Animal Vore -
		Playful predation average hours - The hours-on-average an animal trained in playful predation will engage in vore. 24 means they will, for every 24 hours idle, do one nom.

		Playful predation modifier - A percentage on the hours-on-average, multiplied by the number of prey the animal has, added to their average hours.
					     Lowers how often an animal will play-pred if they have multiple prey already.
					     (eg: if average hours is 24 and mod is 50%; with 0 prey, 24 hours on average, with 1 prey, 36 hours on average, 2, 48 hours, ect.)

		Indescriminate predation - Animals are only allowed to play-pred members of your colony. This option allows them to nom anyone and anything.
					   Can lead to problems, like traders getting stuck on the map due to a endo-napped pawn or wild animals tearing down your doors because they got stuck inside.

		Not-so-playful predation - Play predding is endo only. This option disables that.

	Bonds -
		Bonding is a base game mechanic, occuring rarly when animals and humanoids interact, or when an animal is near their master. 
		Bonds provide a mood boost and easier training, but both animal and master get upset if something happens to the other.

		Endo bond chance - The chance, per vore-tick, for an animal and a humanoid involved in endo-vore to form a bond. Works on wild animals, and will tame them.
				   Only animals that can at least be trained to Guard can bond.

		Predator bonding - Endo bonding will only work if the animal is prey, unless this setting is true.

		Dom-bonding - Endo bonding will only work for non-forced vore, unless this setting is true.

		Voraphile bonds - Makes bonded animals choose their bond for play predding more often, and makes bonds always accept vore proposals.

	Cheaty stuff - 
		Prey recreation - Prey passivly gain recreation need while vored, as long as they don't have one of the negitive prey quirks.
      				  They build up to 50% if willing, and 33% otherwise.

		No bleed out - Caps the Bloodloss hediff to 90%. Prey can still be killed by it indirectly, due to it lowering consciousness. Great for healing vore.

		Staunch bleeding - Lowers the bleeding rate of a prey's wounds gradualy while endo-vored. Does not tend wounds. Great for grapple-voring raiders.

		No extreme temps - Caps both the heat stroke and hypothermia hediffs to 30%. Any stronger, and they start affecting consciousness, and inficting frostbite.

		Curaga Vore - Triples the effectiveness of healing vore. Note that healing vore still won't tend wounds as well as a doctor with decent medicine, but combo'ing tending with healing vore works great.
